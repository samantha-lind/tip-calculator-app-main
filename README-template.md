## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   Vanilla JS

### What I learned

Planning is key! First, identify the components on the page and list out their
required functions. Try to limit the number of components by re-using them where
you can. Next, work through building the components one-by-one. Then lay out the
base HTML and CSS. Finally, add Javascript to bring it to life.
